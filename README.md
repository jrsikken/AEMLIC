The AEMLIC is a 15x20mm board with the AEM10941 Solar Harvesting IC from E-peas. It efficiently converts solar panel energy into LIC charge, it even works with indoor light. It has one regulated output that is enabled when the LIC has sufficient charge, and a low voltage warning that informs the user of impending shutdown when the LIC runs low. It easily integrates in other projects because of the castellated via's, and when soldered onto 0.1' pitch headers it fits in a bread board.

The .xlsx contains the AEMLIC V1 PCB specification, Bill of Materials, the placement drawing, and the XY positions file 
The .zip files contains the PCB gerber files
The .sch and .pcb are Eagle Design files
